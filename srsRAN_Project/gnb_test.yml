# This example configuration outlines how to configure the srsRAN Project gNB to create a single TDD cell
# transmitting in band 78, with 20 MHz bandwidth and 30 kHz sub-carrier-spacing. A USRP B200 is configured 
# as the RF frontend using split 8. Note in this example an external clock source is not used, so the sync 
# is not defined and the default is used.
